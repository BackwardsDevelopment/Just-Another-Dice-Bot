# Just Another Dice Bot

Just a simple Dice bot... it looks for channel names that contain "roll" or "doom" in them, then it will look for input that contains the letter "D" (non case sensitive) followed by a number of any kind. Afterwards it will roll with standard D&D formatting, (2d4+4 = roll 2: 4 sided dice), than add 4 to the sum.

This bot doesn't use standard commands such as !dice etc. It will just look for an input such as d4, 6d8, 2d8+3, 4d4-6, etc.
