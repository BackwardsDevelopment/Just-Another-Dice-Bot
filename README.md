# diceBotV3

Just a simple Dice bot... it looks for channel names that contain "roll" or "doom" in them, then it will look for input that contains the letter "D" (non case sensitive) followed by a number of any kind. Afterwards it will roll with standard D&D formatting, (2d4+4 = roll 2: 4 sided dice, than add 4 to the sum)

P.S. it looks for "Roll" as most servers I am in have a "rolls" channel, or a "rolls-channel" channel. It also looks for "doom" as most servers I am in have a channel titled "roll-of-doom" or "box-of-doom", aka areas to roll for saving throws.
